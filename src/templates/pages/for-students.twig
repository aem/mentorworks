    <h2>Income Share Agreements</h2>
    <p>Your education financing isn't a loan. Income Share Agreements are based on your potential, so you don't needâ€¨a credit check to qualify.</p>
    <p>You'll pay back a portion of your salary: if you hit rough times, your ISA won't be too expensive, but if you excel in your field, your ISA has a cap so you don't overpay.</p>
